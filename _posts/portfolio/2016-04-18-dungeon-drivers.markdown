Dungeon drivers is a turn based strategy game with cards and cars.
The game was an assignment from the [ConceptSleutelaars][conceptsleutelaars]. They pitched the concept of a fantasy themed card game with cars, they explained it as *"Mario Kart meets The Lord of the Rings"*.

We got inspired by this concept and expanded it with different characters and a deck building mechanic that works in combination with customization of your vehicle. The player can choose between different
wheels and weapons, that all have different cards for in the deck.

I was the only programmer in a team of 6 people, the rest of the team were mainly artists.
