Mariachi Mayhem is a fun party game created in 48 hours during the Global Game Jam 2016 with as theme "ritual". The game was created with a
team of 4 people: two 3d/texture artists, one animator and me as programmer.

The goal of the game is to get as much skeletons as possible on the altar in the middle of the screen. To win you can bash your opponents away,
steal the skeleton and stay in the lead.

Normally before I actually start coding I always design the systems with UML. But because I had only 48 hours to complete this game I decided to start coding right away. Because of this and the time pressure of the last day the code is somewhat messy, but nonetheless it became a working fun game and I am proud of the end result.

The game is played best with 4 players (it is possible with a minimum of 2 players) and an xbox controller.
