Mariachi Mayhem is a fun party game created in 48 hours during the Global Game Jam 2016 with as theme "ritual". The game was created with a
team of 4 people: two 3d/texture artists, one animator and me as programmer.

Normally before I actually start coding I always design the system with UML. But because I had only 48 hours to complete this game I decided to start coding right away.
