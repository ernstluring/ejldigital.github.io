# Project Overview
This project was an assignment from the game development studio [8D Games][8dgames]. They were creating an exercise game focused on balance exercise and fall prevention for elderly people in collaboration with UMCG Groningen. A Kinect registers the movement of the balance exercises and converts these in-game to ice skating motions. The data of the players movement collected by the Kinect can be forwarded to a physician or physiotherapist who can inspect this data and see for example if the patient leans to much to the left or right and/or in what kind of physical shape the patient is in.
