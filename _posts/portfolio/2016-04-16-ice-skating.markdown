#Overview
This project was an assignment from the local games studio [8D Games][8dgames]. They were creating an exercise game focused on balance exercise and fall prevention for elderly people. This project was a collaboration with UMCG Groningen and the game works through movement registration with a Kinect.

In addition to the gained fun factor.
