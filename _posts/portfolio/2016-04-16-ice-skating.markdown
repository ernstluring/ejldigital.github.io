# Overview

This project was an assignment from the local games studio [8D Games][8dgames]. They were creating an exercise game focused on balance exercise and fall prevention for elderly people. This project was a collaboration with UMCG Groningen and the game works through movement registration with a Kinect.


The target audience can play the game by doing his or her balance exercises. These movements are converted in-game to ice skating motions. While ice skating in-game the players needs to dodge ice holes and duck for low bridges.


In addition to the gained fun factor by changing a boring exercise to a fun activity. The data of the players movement collected by the Kinect can also be forwarded to a physician or physiotherapist who can inspect this data and see for example if the patient leans to mutch to the left or right and/or in what kind of physical shape the patient is in.
