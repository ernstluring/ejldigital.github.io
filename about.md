## Who Made This

I'm Bradley Taunt, a designer/developer hybrid. 

My passion lies in implementing minimal CSS, with a focus on accessibility and web performance. This theme started as an experiment to see how much could be stripped away from a website, while still maintaining clean and readable content.
