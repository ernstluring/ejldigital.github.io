I am Ernst Luring, a (game) programmer with a love for music, games and food.


I currently study Communication & Multimedia Design at the NHL University of Applied Sciences in Leeuwarden where I specialise in game development and programming. During the course of this study I work in teams on half year projects for real clients. In these projects I learn to set my own learning goals, work in and lead a team and develop my skills as a (game) programmer.
