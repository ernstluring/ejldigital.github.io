I am Ernst Luring, a (game) programmer with a love for music, games and food.


I currently study Communication & Multimedia Design at the NHL University of Applied Sciences in Leeuwarden, where I specialise in game development and programming. During the course of this study I work in teams on half year projects for real clients. In these projects I learn to work in multidisciplinary teams, lead them with the scrum managing framework through the different phases of development and develop my skills as a (game) programmer.


At the moment I am mostly focusing on programming in C# in combination with the Unity game engine, but I also have experience with C++(SFML) and HTML5/Javascript. Often I get curious and excited of new and or different programming languages and take quick peeks inside languages like Go and Rust.
